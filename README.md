 to find in a graph with one component a set of paths ( path definition: a list of vertices with 2 or more members, where each successive vertex pair in the list is connected by an edge ) which covers every edge exactly once. Of all such possible sets you want to select the one that has the longest paths and the fewest paths with just one edge.
